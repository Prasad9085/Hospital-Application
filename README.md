Project Details:
Title Of Project: Hospital Application (Power chart)

Description:
The tool is designed for hospitals, physicians and nurse, to documents both the clinical conditions 
they diagnose as well as the services and items delivered to beneficiaries to treat on their conditions. 
This helps to manage the inpatients and their medications prescribed in the registered encounter. On 
closing the encounter tool generates the invoice for all orders placed on that encounter along with all 
other additional charges involved. The tool provides clinical history of patient to physician/nurse, by 
rendering all the previous encounters and medications. The tool also provides the patient portal 
where authorised patients are allowed to view the history of their encounters and medications that 
are related to them.

The admin of the application will have an ability to manage hospitals and the associated branches. 
Tool allows admin to view the details of all the active encounters of hospital with respect to each 
associated branch. And admin can also access all the invoices generated for each encounter and all 
financial transactions made in each branch.
